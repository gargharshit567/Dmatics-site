   <p>primeval times. The principle of Theology is to explain everything by
supernatural Wills. That principle can never be set aside until we
acknowledge the search for Causes to be beyond our reach, and limit
ourselves to the knowledge of Laws. As long as men persist in
attempting to answer the insolube questions which occupied the
attention of the childhood of our race, by far the more rational plan is to
do as was done then, that is, simply to give free play to the imagination.
These spontaneous beliefs have gradually fallen into disuse, not because
they have been disproved, but because mankind has become more
enlightened as to its wants and the scope of its powers, and has gradually
given an entirely new direction to its specuative efforts. If we insist
upon pentetrating the unattainable mystery of the essential Cause that
produces phenomena, there is no hypothesis more satisfactory than that
they proceed from Wills dwelling in them or outside them; an hypothesis
which assimilates them to the effect produced by the desires which exist
within ourselves. Were it not for the pride induced by metaphysical and
scientific studies, it would be inconceivable that any atheist, modern or
ancient, should have believed that his vague hypotheses on such a
subject were preferable to this direct mode of explanation. And it was
the only mode which really satisfied the reason, until men began to see 
of Nature is doubtlesss very imperfect in every respect; but its production 
is far more compatible with the hypothesis of an intelligent Will than
with that of a blind mechanism, Persistent atheists therefore would seem
to be the most illogical52 of theologists: because they occupy themselves
with theological problems, and yet reject the only appropriate method of
handling them. But the fact is that pure Atheism even in the present day
is very rare. What is called Atheism is usually a phase of Pantheism,
which is really nothing but a relapse disguised under learned terms, into
a vague and abstract form of Fetichism. And it is not impossible that it 
may lead to the reproduction in one form or other of every theological 
phase as soon as the check which modern society still imposes on
metaphysical extravagance has become somewhat weakened. The
adoption of such theories as a satisfactory system of belief, indicates a
very exaggerated or rather false view of intellectual requirements, and a
