        <p>primeval times. The principle of Theology is to explain everything by
          supernatural Wills. That principle can never be set aside until we
          acknowledge the search for Causes to be beyond our reach, and limit
          ourselves to the knowledge of Laws. As long as men persist in
          attempting to answer the insolube questions which occupied the
          attention of the childhood of our race, by far the more rational plan is to
          do as was done then, that is, simply to give free play to the imagination.
          These spontaneous beliefs have gradually fallen into disuse, not because
          they have been disproved, but because mankind has become more
          enlightened as to its wants and the scope of its powers, and has gradually
          given an entirely new direction to its specuative efforts. If we insist
          upon pentetrating the unattainable mystery of the essential Cause that
          produces phenomena, there is no hypothesis more satisfactory than that
          they proceed from Wills dwelling in them or outside them; an hypothesis
          which assimilates them to the effect produced by the desires which exist
          within ourselves. Were it not for the pride induced by metaphysical and
          scientific studies, it would be inconceivable that any atheist, modern or
          ancient, should have believed that his vague hypotheses on such a
          subject were preferable to this direct mode of explanation. And it was
          the only mode which really satisfied the reason, until men began to see
          of Nature is doubtlesss very imperfect in every respect; but its production
          is far more compatible with the hypothesis of an intelligent Will than
          with that of a blind mechanism, Persistent atheists therefore would seem
          to be the most illogical52 of theologists: because they occupy themselves
          with theological problems, and yet reject the only appropriate method of
          handling them. But the fact is that pure Atheism even in the present day
          is very rare. What is called Atheism is usually a phase of Pantheism,
          which is really nothing but a relapse disguised under learned terms, into
          a vague and abstract form of Fetichism. And it is not impossible that it
          may lead to the reproduction in one form or other of every theological
          phase as soon as the check which modern society still imposes on
          metaphysical extravagance has become somewhat weakened. The
          adoption of such theories as a satisfactory system of belief, indicates a
          very exaggerated or rather false view of intellectual requirements, and a
